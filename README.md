# movie_recommender
A small ML nlp project where we are recommending movies based on a review of a movie. 
Couldn't upload the data because it's too big, but if you want to try this out you can get it at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews and https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
(Don't forget to change the direction to the data in the program)
